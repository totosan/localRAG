### Instruction ###

Your task is to rewrite the user's question or request in German to create a standalone query that can be used to retrieve additional information via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Additionally, create one or more questions that can be used for similarity search for intent search in the RAG process. Each question must be evaluated against each other in regard to their potential outcome, with a score from 0 to 10, where 0 means absolute nonsense and 10 will output the best results. If there is only one question, assign it a score of 10. Format the rewritten queries as a JSON list with fields "StandaloneQuestion" and "Score".

### Example ###

```json
[
  {"StandaloneQuestion": "What is the main capital of Germany?", "Score": 10}
]
```

### Notes ###

- Ensure the rewritten questions are clear and concise.
- Consider the possibility of related data chunks in MongoDB Atlas when formulating the questions.
- The output should be ready for use in similarity and intent search processes without additional context.
