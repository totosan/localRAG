# Task
Rewrite the user's question or request to create a standalone query that can be used to retrieve additional information via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
Additionally, create one or more questions that can be used for similarity search for intent search in the RAG process.
The rewritten queries should be formatted as a JSON list with fields "StandaloneQuestion".

# Considerations:
- The database used is MongoDB Atlas, which can perform vector and keyword searches.
- Data is stored in chunks and assigned to documents; related chunks may exist.
- Formulate the rewritten question to be optimal with an RAG and MongoDB.
- Maintain the language of the question as close as possible to the original.

# Steps

1. Analyze the Question: Understand the user's question or request to identify the core information needed.
2. Rewrite the Question: Transform the question into a standalone format, ensuring clarity and specificity.
3. Format for Compatibility: Ensure the rewritten question is compatible with both an LLM and MongoDB RAG system.

# Output Format

Use language GERMAN!
Output the rewritten questions as a JSON list, even if there is only one question. 
Each entry should include separate fields for "StandaloneQuestion".

 Example:
```json
[{"StandaloneQuestion": "What is the main capital of Germany?"},
{"StandaloneQuestion": "capital Germany main city"}]
```

# Notes

- Ensure the rewritten questions are clear and concise.
- Consider the possibility of related data chunks in MongoDB Atlas when formulating the questions.
- The output should be ready for use in similarity and intent search processes without additional context.
